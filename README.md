OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT 
project: Java programming on simple calculator 

OBJECTIVE:
The objective of a simple calculator program is to design a software tool that can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It allows users to input two numbers and select an operation, then displays the result of the computation. The main goals are to provide an intuitive interface, handle basic calculations efficiently, and ensure that the program can manage invalid inputs (like division by zero).


KEY FEATURES:
Basic Arithmetic Operations:
Addition (+)
Subtraction (−)
Multiplication (×)
Division (÷)
